Then you're going to love this!

This WooCommerce plugin makes integrating your store with Payfort a walk in the park! In the same time it would take you to make a cup of some great turkish coffee, you could be up and running with online payments!

Doesn't matter if you're in Bahrain, the UAE or Morocco .. it'll work fine either way!
